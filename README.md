# Netflix Dashboard

Netflix is a streaming services that offers variety of TV Shows and Movies. There are so many category in there such as Anime, Documentary, Sci-Fi, etc. It is available worldwide except for some country who have their own restriction.

In this case, I tried to make a dashboard about Netlix by using Tableau. I used Python to split data containing Country where Movies and TV Shows Produced, Category, Director, and Cast for the Movies and TV Show. I also edited some Country names such as West Germany to Germany and Soviet Union to Russia due to the existence of that country and changed some types. Here is the look of the Dashboard
